## What is Creating Objects?

Creating Objects is a computer program designed in ruby to simulate planting 7g of seeds from a seed stock geneback, uptading the genebank information. In addition, the program is designed for proceesing the information and determinate which genes are genetically-linked. 

## How to install Creating Objects?

Download the code from Github into the folder desired. For example: 
```
cd
mkdir assignment_1
cd assignment_1
git clone git@github.com:AlbertoGonzalezDelgado/ruby_assignments.git
cd ruby_assignments/creating_objects/
```


## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command, adding the arguments recquired:

```
ruby Proccessing.rb <seed_stock_data_file> <gene_information_file> <cross_data_file> <output> 
```
**Arguments:**
1. **Seed stock data file:** file where current information of the seed stock genebank is located.
2. **Gene information file:** file where information of mutants phenotypes is included.
3. **Cross data file**: file where the information of observed crossings is located
4. **Output**: file where the updated information of seed stock gene bank is saved after planting the seeds.

To run the program using the files contained in [files folder](files/), just execute the following command:
```
ruby Proccessing.rb ./files/seed_stock_data.tsv ./files/gene_information.tsv ./files/cross_data.tsv ./new_stock_file.tsv  
```
