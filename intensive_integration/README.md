## What is Intensive Integration?

Intensive Integration is a computer program designed in ruby to searching for interactions between genes and creating a gene interaction newtork wich maximum depth is 4. In addition, the program will search for GO and KEGG annotation of these genes and it will be saved both interaction network and annotations into a file.

## How to run Intensive Integration?
Download the code as [README file for assignment answers](../README.md) indicates. 

## Requirements:
```
gem install rgl 
```
## Usage:

To run the program, execute the following command (inside intensive_integration/ folder), adding the arguments recquired:

```
cd assignments_answers/intensive_integration/
```
```
ruby .rb <genes_file> <output_file> 
```
**Arguments:**
1. **[Genes_file:](documents/ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt)** file that provides a list of target genes that will be used for searching for interactions and annotations.
2. **Output_file**: file where the report will be saved. Here there is an  [ouput txt file](documents/) that shows the file generated by the program.

To run the program using the files contained in [files folder](documents/), just execute the following command:
```
ruby .rb documents/ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt ./documents/output.txt
```
If output pathway specified already exists, the program will ask you if you want to overwrite it. Y/y (yes) or N/n (no) input is expected.



## Output
The output is verbose, it will be saved into a [output txt file](documents/).
