# == InteractionNetwork
#
# This is a representation of a gene interaction network.
#
# == Summary
# 
# InteractionNetwork class allows us to identify interactions within an input gene list from the IntAct database.
# We can also generate interaction networks connecting previously identified interactors with a defined maximum network depth (default = 3 nodes).
#
# The initialize method takes two arguments, depth and gene_list, and sets default values
# for these arguments if they are not provided when the object is created.
# The method then calls the find_first_interactors method on the gene_list argument, 
# passing in a value of 1 for the second argument. This is followed by a loop that calls
# the find_first_interactors method again, but this time with the @@multi_gene_list array 
# and the current loop iteration as arguments.
#
# Next, the code iterates over the @@full_interactions array and adds each edge to the 
# @@full_network object, setting the edge weight to 1. It then creates an array of connected
# components in the network, and loops over these components to find any that contain the seed genes.
# For each component that contains seed genes, the code uses the combination method 
# to find all possible pairs of genes, and then uses the dijkstra_shortest_path method 
# to find the shortest path between these pairs. If the length of the path is less than or equal 
# to 4, the path is added to the @@significant_paths hash with the gene pair as the key and the 
# path as the value.
