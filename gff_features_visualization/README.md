## How to run Intensive Integration?
Download the code as [README file for assignment answers](../README.md) indicates. 

## Requirements:

1. [Bio-Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/bio-gem/versions/1.3.6)
```
gem install bio-gem
```
## Usage:

To run the program, execute the following command (inside gff_features_visualization/ folder), adding the arguments recquired:

```
cd assignments_answers/gff_features_visalization/
```
```
ruby .rb <genes_file> <output_file> 
```
**Arguments:**
1. **[Genes_file:](documents/ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt)** file that provides a list of target genes that will be used for searching for interactions and annotations.
2. **Output_file**: file where the report will be saved. Here there is an  [ouput txt file](documents/) that shows the file generated by the program.

To run the program using the files contained in [files folder](documents/), just execute the following command:
```
ruby .rb documents/ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt ./documents/output.txt
```
If output pathway specified already exists, the program will ask you if you want to overwrite it. Y/y (yes) or N/n (no) input is expected.



## Output
